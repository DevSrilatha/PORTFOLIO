    <p>
      Hi, I'm <strong>Nama Srilatha</strong>, an enthusiastic and self-driven <strong>Software Development Engineer</strong> passionate about building impactful web applications. With a strong foundation in the <strong>MERN Stack</strong> (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), I enjoy turning ideas into real-world solutions through code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve built projects ranging from a full-fledged <em>AI-powered job recommendation platform</em> to fun games like <em>Tic-Tac-Toe</em> and <em>Stone-Paper-Scissors</em>. I love solving problems, collaborating with other developers, and continuously improving my skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also experienced in deploying applications using <strong>Vercel</strong>, making my React projects live, fast, and accessible with custom domains and automatic CI/CD workflows. I believe in not just building, but also delivering clean, production-ready apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I’m focused on sharpening my <strong>Data Structures & Algorithms</strong> knowledge to pursue opportunities at top tech companies. I believe in writing clean, scalable code and learning by doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring new tech, reading up on AI advancements, and occasionally contributing to open-source.
